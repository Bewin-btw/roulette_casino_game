README for Turtle Roulette Game with Pygame Sound Effects

Overview

This README provides details about a Python-based roulette game implemented using the Turtle graphics library, enhanced with sound effects via Pygame. The game features a graphical representation of a roulette wheel, betting table, and chips, allowing users to place bets, spin the wheel, and potentially win based on the outcome of the spin.

Features

Graphical User Interface: Utilizes Turtle graphics for drawing the roulette wheel, betting table, chips, and ball.
Sound Effects: Integrates Pygame to play background music continuously and specific sounds for win, lose, and spin actions.
Interactive Betting System: Players can choose chip values and place bets on the roulette table. The game calculates winnings based on the roulette outcome.
Winning Number History: Displays the most recent winning numbers.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Turtle Graphics Library (comes with Python)
Pygame
Installation

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Install Pygame via pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Download the game script to a local directory.
Running the Game

Execute the script in your Python environment:

bash
Copy code
python roulette_game.py
Ensure your working directory contains the required sound files (background_music.mp3, lose_sound.mp3, spin_sound.wav, win_sound.mp3) for the sound effects to play correctly.

Gameplay

Start the Game: Click the "Start" button to begin.
Place Bets: Select a chip value, then click on the betting table to place your bet.
Spin the Wheel: After placing your bets, click the "Spin" button. The roulette wheel will spin, and the ball will land on a random number.
Winning/Losing: Wins are calculated based on the matching bets on the roulette outcome. Winning bets will trigger the win sound, and losing will play the lose sound.
New Round: Click "New Round" to reset the table and start another game.
Game States

STARTUP: Initial state, ready to start or place bets.
RUNNING: The wheel is spinning.
DONE: The spin has ended, and the game is ready for a new round.
Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the constants for colors, fonts, chip values, and adding new sound files for different game events.

Sound Management

Sounds are managed using Pygame's mixer module. Ensure the sound files are in the same directory as the game script or update the paths in the script accordingly.
